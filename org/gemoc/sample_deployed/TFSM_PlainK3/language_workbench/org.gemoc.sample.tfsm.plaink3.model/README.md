ecore of the TFSM

IMPORTANT NOTE:
the current version has operations and currentState attribute which should come from the DSA, 
they are added in the model only for visualisation and simulation purpose waiting a better solution based on
K3 serialisation of aspects (ie. that will produce an ecore such as the one here, but based on a simplier ecore + DSA aspects in K3)
